# FIRE-FREQUENCIES-Electromagnetic-Fire-Extinguishing-Systems

Heat is the friction caused by rapidly moving electromagnetic waves. The movement of electromagnetic waves around atoms causes molecules to move, spin, bounce off each other, and break apart. As molecules get moving violently with increased heat, molecules break apart, releasing molecular enthalpy. This molecular elnthalpy causes changes to orbitals and releases photons as black body radiation. Photons from heated molecules impact new materials (fuel) and fuels release electrons via photoelectric effect. Electrons tear (burn) through materials and impact into oxygen.  If oxygen gains two electrons, it attains the same electron configuration as neon. When oxygen is oxidized in this manner, it glows like neon, and we have a visible flame ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.

Fire can be put out with electromagnetic frequency (sound). The inverse frequency of the flame would create a null frequency.

## FireProve Systems

Fire can be put out with electromagnetic frequency (sound). The inverse frequency of the flame would create a null frequency. FireProve systems will use directional microphones to capture the frequncy of a detected fire. The FireProve system will use metal speakers to play the inverse frequency of the fire into the flame and heat source. This noise cancelling fire extinguishing system will be usefull for buildings, aviation, mobile use, etc.
